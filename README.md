This is similar to React's `Create React App`. The idea is that it provides a
few basic boilerplates and some stong opinions so you can get coding on a
production quality app as quickly as possible.

```bash
$npx init socket-app -h

usage: create-socket-app [vanilla | react | vue | angular | svelt | tonic]
```

```bash
$npx init socket-app vanilla
