# Create Socket App 

`Create Socket App` is similar to React's `Create React App`, it will help you build native apps for mobile and desktop with Svelte, Reactjs, Vuejs and others!  
The idea is to provide a few basic boilerplates and some strong opinions so you can get coding on a production quality app as quickly as possible.  

## Set up your Socket environement  

You can find more details about prerequisites, instructions, and many useful tips in [Socket Runtime](https://sockets.sh/) documentation.

$npx create-socket-app -h
