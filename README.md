This is similar to React's `Create React App`. The idea is that it provides a
few basic boilerplates and some stong opinions so you can get coding on a
production quality app as quickly as possible.

## Usage: 

With npm:
```bash
npm create socket-app [react | svelte | tonic | vanilla | vue]
```

With yarn:
```bash
yarn create socket-app [react | svelte | tonic | vanilla | vue]
```

With pnpm:
```bash
pnpm create socket-app [react | svelte | tonic | vanilla | vue]
```

Now you should have a directory structure like this:
```bash
.
├── README.md
├── build.js
├── package.json
├── socket.ini
├── src
│   ├── icon.png
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.html
│   └── index.js
└── test
    ├── index.js
    └── test-context.js
```
