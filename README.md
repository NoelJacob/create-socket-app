# Create Socket App 

`Create Socket App` is similar to React's `Create React App`. The idea is to provides a
few basic boilerplates and some strong opinions so you can get coding on a
production quality app as quickly as possible.

## Getting Started 

**You’ll need to have Node 16.0.0 or later version on your local development machine .**  

Creat an empty directory and that's it, you are ready to go!

You may choose one of the following methods: 

**npm**

Any of these following commands will work
```bash
npm init socket-app [react | svelte | tonic | vanilla | vue]
npm create socket-app [react | svelte | tonic | vanilla | vue]

```

`Note`  

You can start a new app from a template by choosing `[template-name]` in the creation commands above.  
  
**yarn**
```bash
yarn create socket-app [react | svelte | tonic | vanilla | vue]
```

**pnpm**
```bash
pnpm create socket-app [react | svelte | tonic | vanilla | vue]
```

<!-- This is a draft video, I liked how they have a video tutorial in the `react` website. if it's a good idea I'll make a better one-->



## Output:

Now inside of your directory,you should have a `directory structure` like this:

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── build.js
├── package.json
├── socket.ini
├── src
│   ├── icon.png
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.html
│   └── index.js
└── test
    ├── index.js
    └── test-context.js
```
